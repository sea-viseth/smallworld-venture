  "New team members are recruited through a trial apprenticeship program where the office is open to hangout, meet with different team members, and to test the general atmosphere. We only hire those who show strong motivation to collaborate with a team, or wish to build their own team.",
  "We donâ€™t hire managers to direct others, everyone works together as self-directed team players. We want new recruits to tell us what we can do better, and to tell us how they feel they can contribute.",
  "Team members are hired for a lifetime of service, meaning that we will support and applaud your success even if you step out on your own business venture. We want all our team members to be able to collaborate as entrepreneurs while we extend our efforts out into the community."
